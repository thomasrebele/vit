.SH NAME
vitrc \- Configuration file for the vit(1) command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.vitrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B VIT
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.I .vitrc
\&. This file must be located in the user's home directory.

Except for comments (lines starting with "#"), currently the only acceptable
commands in .vitrc are
.B map
commands and
.B set
commands.

.SS MAP COMMANDS
.B map
commands take the form

.RS
map <KEY>=<KEY-SEQUENCE>
.RE

where:
.RS
.TP
<KEY>
should represent a key or combination of keys, such as "a" or a <KEY-CODE> as
listed below.

.P
and
.P
<KEY-SEQUENCE>
is a sequence of <KEY>s to emulate. The result should be the same as if these
keys were pressed manually by the user.

<KEY-CODE>s are strings that represent keys. The following may be used:
.br
Function keys: <F1> <F2> <F3> <F4> <F5> <F6> <F7> <F8> <F9> <F10> <F11> <F12>

Navigation keys: <Home> <End> <PageUp> <PageDown> <Up> <Down> <Right> <Left>

Editing keys: <Insert> <Del> <Backspace> <Space> <Tab> <Return>

Modifier combinations: \\ca for Ctrl + "a" combination.

.SS SET COMMANDS
.B set
commands take the form

.RS
set <VAR NAME>=<VAR VAL>
.RE

where valid variable names (<VAR NAME>) and their acceptable values (<VAR VAL>)
are listed below. Note that the default value is listed immediately after the
variable name.

.TP
.B burndown=no
When set to "yes", VIT will display the time until convergence in the upper
left corner. It is set to "no" by default because it requires extra time to
obtain (from running 'task burndown' in the background. This variable was
essentially set to "yes" for VIT versions 1.2 and below.

.TP
.B confirmation=yes
When set to "yes" (default), VIT will ask for confirmation before marking a task as
done, deleting a task, or quitting VIT. Set to "no" to disable the prompts.

.TP
.B wait=yes
When set to "no", VIT will not show output of the task command after
modifications to a task are made.  By default, VIT will show the output of the
task command and wait for enter.

.TP
.B show_empty_report=no
When set to "no" (default), VIT will not show a task report if there are no
tasks in it. It will show the last non-empty report.
When set to "yes", VIT will display "NO MATCHES" instead of the table.


.SH EXAMPLES
.SS EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Note that for many of the examples, you need to have the appropriate extension
installed and in your PATH. Recall that after :! a 'w' means that VIT should
"wait". This allows another command to take over (e.g. Vim when you're editing
a task) and for you to see the output of a command. After :! a 'r' means that
VIT should reread your list of tasks. This should be used when your external
command changes the task data.

.TP
.B map \\\\cn=:!wr tasknote %TASKID<Return>
When Ctrl + n is pressed, runs the command 'tasknote <ID>', where <ID> is the
ID of the task that is currently selected in VIT.

.TP
.B map c=:! task %TASKID rc.defaultwidth:200 | grep -o -P -m 1 "(ftp|http)s?://\\\\S*" | tr -d '\n' | xsel -b<Return>
Copies the first link it finds to the clipboard.

.TP
.B map Z=:!rw echo "Changing due date\n"; task %TASKID modify due:$(read -p "How many days? " DAYS; echo $DAYS)days<Return>
Asks you for input and then changes the due date of the selected task to NOW plus that many days.

.TP
.B map <Left>=:!wr task $(task _get %TASKID.parent) edit<Return>
When the left arrow key is pressed, edits the parent of a recurring task
(do not use on non-recurring task).

.SS INTERNAL COMMANDS
.TP
.B map Q=
Disables whatever the Q key is bound to internally in VIT, which is a quick quit.
